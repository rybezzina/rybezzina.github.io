        <h2>Information about myself</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Ryan. I am 20 years old and I enjoy playing video games and watching movies.<br> I grew up in Oldham originally, however I have lived in Manchester since I was around 9 years old.<br> My dad is half Maltese which is where
            my last name comes from. I have a<br> dog called Lola and a snake called Sam. I look forward to learning more code after I have finished with the<br> Code Nation course, as this has all been new to me but I am really enjoying it. I hope that
            in the future, I will be able to be a software developer.

        <h2>Why I am interested in technology and wanted to get in to coding</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I first started using technology at a very young age, as I was brought up playing video games by my dad.<br> He got me in to playing video games and my first console was an original Xbox, but as I got more interested I tried even older technology<br>            like the N64. I believe that if I am going to be getting into work and doing a job that takes up a lot of my life,<br> it should be doing something that I really enjoy.

        <h2>Call of Duty</h2>
        <p>
            At around the age of 11, I had many friends that played on Playstation with me. During these times,<br> we loved to play Call of Duty. I would play it basically every single night non-stop and we would<br> always go for high killstreaks. As
            I have grown up more, I don't enjoy the Call of Duty franchise as<br> much so I tend to not buy the games anymore but I have very fond childhood memories.<br> My favourite Call of Duty game would have to be Call of Duty: Back Ops 2, because
            these are the games I played most and enjoyed the most as a child.

        <h2>League of Legends</h2>
        <p>
            From 2019 up until now, I have been really enjoying League of Legends. It is a MOBA game which means Multiplayer Online Battle Area. I managed to save up to buy my own PC in 2019 and this was one of the first games I tried since I had heard so much about
            it. It has been one of the biggest Esports games for a very long time and the events that are hosted for this game such as the LEC (European Championship) are really exciting. My favourite champion in the game is Irelia.
