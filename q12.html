        <h1>Question 1</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Describe the purpose of using IT in creating your website and how you will use IT to plan and carry out the necessary tasks.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            The purpose of using IT in creating my website is that everything will be in the same place for me to take a look at. For example, Visual Studio Code has helped me a lot in coding my website as I can go back and take a look at the code I have already
            done on one page and apply it to the next. Furthermore, the hotkeys on Visual Code make it a lot easier for me to view and edit my code, such as using "CTRL+/". As I had to write coursework aswell as make my website, I decided to put the two
            together and put my coursework within my website. This means that the target audience for my website will be possible employers who want to take a look at my code, aswell as whoever it is that needs to take a look at my coursework.<br><br>            As my work will all be done on my computer and online, I am able to have quick and easy access to my notes that I have made whilst learning how to code. This makes it a lot easier for me to remember and learn what it is that I need to do for
            each section, as I will always have example code in my notes. This will help me be successful in achieving the required outcomes in my plan, because it gives me a place to look quickly if I need to refresh my memory whilst writing my code.
            If I am not able to find the right things that I need in my notes, I also have access to google where I can use different websites to help my remember how to do certain things, such as resizing images.

    <div class="question_2">
        <h1>Question 2</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete your website - explain what IT systems and software applications you need to be successful in your website project, and how you will use them.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            A method I will use to complete my website is uploading my website to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>. This method needs to be completed for my website to be finished, otherwise people will
            not be able to view my website unless they have the files downloaded on to their system. Uploading the webiste to Github is free and will allow people from around the world view what I have coded, as long as they have internet access. A good
            thing about this is that I can save the link for my website and give it to possible employers that want to take a look at some of my work, and they will be able to have all of the code visible to them immediately.<br><br>A resource that I
            used to complete my website is <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trello</a>. After using Trello to organise the group task when making the game with python, I decided to use it again to help me keep my
            tasks in order for this task. A link to my Trello board can be found <a href="https://trello.com/b/8cb557lZ/website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I personally think that this is a really good resourse to use when working
            on projects, as everything is clear and easy to see and it is very customizable. When working in group projects, you can add names to the tasks and give deadlines for each of them, which makes it very easy to see who is doing what and when
            it needs to be done for. Although this website is good for seeing who is doing what task, it does not have any way to directly communicate with your partners, which can sometimes make it difficult to chase people up or ask for help. Due to
            this, using something like <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom</a> is needed if you are to work in a group.<br><br> For a basic website to be successful, you require the skill of being able to code in
            HTML aswell as using CSS. This is the minimum amount of skill needed to make a website look presentable, as there won't really be any graphics or animations and it will most likely just be still images with information. For a more professional
            looking website that you are planning on attracting more attention to, you would need skill with cyber security and some knowledge with graphic design. As there will be more traffic to your website, you need to keep details entered from visitors,
            for example, safe.
