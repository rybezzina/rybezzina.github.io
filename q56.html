            As I used Trello to plan my website out, I tried to stick to it as much as I could. This meant that there were some things that I had to push back because they were too complicated at the time or I just simply did not get the time to get round to them.
            As I went along with my website, my family would come in and take a look at what I was up to. Although at first it was a little frustrating, I decided to take advantage of that and ask them for suggestions on what I could add or change to
            the website. I added their suggestions to Trello and looked back and forth to improve my website.<br><br>Using their suggestions, I decided to keep the size of the text at a larger size than other websites, as some people may struggle
            to read the smaller letters. The larder letters are much more clear to read than a smaller sized font, and using arial also made it very readable. I also think that adding the boxes around the text made it easier to read and follow for people
            that have a harder time concentrating.<br><br> To make sure that my website looked as intended, I kept saving the code after writing something extra and refreshing my web page. This would give me a live update of what I was changing.<br><br>            I have used a CSS file on my website which contains all of the styling methods. This was a very good thing to do as it was much simpler to go back and change something, and it also applied to multiple things throughout my other files. This
            meant that I could make all of the text boxes like this one have a border around them with one line of code, instead of making it add a box every single time I added text.

        <h2>Describe ways to improve your productivity and efficiency throughout this project. If you could have been more productive or efficient, how would you implement this for a future project?</h2>

        <p>
            To improve my productivity and efficiency on this project, I think I could have had a tab open for a website like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack overflow</a>. Stack overflow is essentially
            a message/help board online that people can ask questions and give answers on. It would have helped with my productivity and efficiency as I would have had a quicker answer to the problems I ran in to, such as resizing and positioning my images.
            Although help is eventually found, there is a chance that someone may have given an answer that you dont understand and it might send you into confusion even more than you already were. To make sure I am more efficient in a future project,
            I will make sure to open up a board such as Stack overflow, or find something similar so that I can have answers faster than what I had them this time around.
