        <br>
        <h2>Describe the legal guidelines and risks that might impact your website project - how does GDPR and copyright affect website development?</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Depending on each digital project, different guidelines from the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GDPR</a> apply to it. As I mentioned on Question 2, if a web page expects lots of traffic and they are having
            their customers input information, there needs to be some sort of cyber security methods that prevent hackers from taking it. It is the owners of the web page/business' job to ensure that information saved into their database is safe, otherwise
            they will be held accountable for their website not being secure enough to have data saved onto it.<br><br> Copyright laws also apply to digital projects. This means that you must make sure that all of the resources you use on your website
            is non-copyrighted, otherwise the owner of the resource can take legal action. If the resource you want to use is copyrighted, but you really want to use it, you can try to get permission from the owner of this resource to use it on your web
            page.

            The main software I used when creating my web page was Visual Studio Code. This software allowed me to make multiple HTML files aswell as a CSS stylesheet in the same place, which made for great ease of access. Being able to quickly hop between my files
            in one place made it easy to check back at previous code, or change things and update it quickly using the CSS file. Without CSS, the web page was very boring and even adding a background wasn't the same. I tried to add a background using
            only HTML to start with and this made the background harder to position, aswell as making it move with the page when I scrolled. Using CSS made it possible to have the background sit at the back and not move, aswell as fit the entire page
            easily.
            <br><br> I also used Trello when planning my we page. I liked using this because I could note down my ideas as I thought of them and when I went back to update it I could see what I had to do next.
